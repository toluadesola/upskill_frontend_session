                            <p>I worked in the accounts department of a hotel before starting at Decagon. My experience at Decagon has been 
                                really challenging and the same time refreshing because I get to learn new problem-solving concepts and techniques 
                                everyday. It's a six months of dedication and sacrifice which will definitely be rewarding, you can do

                                My experience in Decagon has been rigorous but educational. I Have learnt iOS technical skills, agile skills and communication 
                                skills. To anyone interested in joining the program, be determined, make sure software development is really what you want to do.
